# Streamo-streaming-app

## Hi There,
### This is a streaming application built in MERN stack.
For State management I have used Redux, backend is created with node.js and mongoDB, and for RTMP server I have used node-media-server.

This project is still in the development phase. You can fork repo for more updates :)
